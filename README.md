## Associations of sarcopenia, sarcopenia components and sarcopenic obesity with cancer incidence: a prospective cohort study of 414,094 participants

In this research I applied multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, maximizing likelihood with Efronâ€™s approach, to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of sarcopenia stages and its components with total and site-specific cancer incidence. The proportional hazard assumption was checked by tests based on Schoenfeld residuals.

Sarcopenia and its components were mainly associated with higher risk of gastrointestinal tract cancers, detecting also sexual dimorphisms. Increasing awareness of sarcopenia detection, as well as establishing treat frameworks, can hold a potential benefit of risk reduction in gastrointestinal-related carcinogenesis.
